\section{Experimental Plan}
\label{sec:Experimental Plan}
We mainly investigate two things. Read performance and write performance. Each test is different.

At the end, we test our implementation on real customer data. We have access to a large retail store database.

With this test, we will measure the effects of bla bla bla.


\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:Experimental Setup}
For experiments, a workstation was used. We remove database response time and measure only in-memory performance.


\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:Experimental Results}
In terms of statistics, we make sure bla bla bla.
